// Variables
Define variables for the map such as zoom level, center coordinates, map tiles, mouse coordinates, panning state, grid, crime select, latlong dictionary, maximum crime count and maximum count.

// Color Scale Function
Define function colorScale() to calculate color scale based on data count:
  - Accepts a count as argument.
  - Calculates ratio of the count in relation to minimum and maximum count.
  - Calculates color by linear interpolation.
  - Returns the color.

// Build Latitude/Longitude Dictionary Function
Define function buildLatLongDict() to build a dictionary with latitude and longitude as keys and count of crimes as values:
  - Accepts selectedCrime as an argument.
  - Iterates over each row of map data.
  - Increments the count of crime for each latitude/longitude key in the dictionary.
  - Updates the maximum crime count if needed.

// Rebuild Latitude/Longitude Dictionary Function
Define function rebuildLatLongDictForCrime() to rebuild the latitude/longitude dictionary based on the selected crime:
  - Selects the crime from the dropdown.
  - Calls buildLatLongDict() with the selected crime.

// New York Crime Class
Define class NewYorkCrime with properties name and id.
  - Setup() method to initialize the crime visualization.
  - Draw() method to update the visual representation of data.
  - Conversion functions to convert between tile coordinates and longitude/latitude and vice versa.
  - degreesPerPixel() function to calculate the degrees per pixel based on the zoom level.

// Mouse Event Functions
Define mousePressed() and mouseReleased() to handle panning:
  - When the mouse is pressed, enable panning.
  - When the mouse is released, disable panning.

// Key Press Function
Define keyPressed() to handle zooming in and out with arrow keys:
  - If up arrow key is pressed, increment zoom.
  - If down arrow key is pressed, decrement zoom.
  - Constrain the zoom level between a minimum and maximum value.

// Zoom Functions
Define zoomIn() and zoomOut() functions to handle zoom in and out when + and - buttons are clicked:
  - If zoom in button is clicked, increment zoom.
  - If zoom out button is clicked, decrement zoom.
  - Constrain the zoom level between a minimum and maximum value.

// Event Listeners
When the document is loaded, get the zoom in and zoom out buttons from the document and add click event listeners to them to call the respective zoom functions.
